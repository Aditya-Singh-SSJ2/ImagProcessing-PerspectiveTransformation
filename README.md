# Image Transformation with OpenCV in Python to Perform Perspective Transformation

This repository contains code for performing image transformation, specifically perspective transformation, using OpenCV in Python. The project serves as a resource for a YouTube tutorial on the basics of perspective transformation in digital image processing.

## Overview
In image processing, there are two main types of transformations:
1. **Geometrical Transformation** - changes the pixel positions and shape of the image.
2. **Intensity Transformation** - alters pixel brightness or contrast.

**Perspective Transformation** is a type of geometrical transformation where the pixel coordinates are modified to simulate a change in viewpoint, making it appear as though the image was viewed from a different angle.

## YouTube Tutorial
This GitHub repository complements the YouTube video tutorial: [Perspective Transformation in OpenCV](https://youtu.be/y1EgAzQLB_o).

This project is a practical guide to applying perspective transformations, a foundational concept in computer vision, and will help users develop essential image manipulation skills using OpenCV.
